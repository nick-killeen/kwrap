TODO:
 - Means to buff ttl of already existing Act, and re-adding it to the cycle if its lifetime is already 0.
 - Consider how runKW can be modified to include multiple buckets by resolving ids. Is it desirable to have one interpreter for all buckets, or an interpreter for each bucket?
 - Stats collection.
